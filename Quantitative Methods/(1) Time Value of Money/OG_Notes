3 Ways to interpret interest rates:
  1) Rates of return investors need to receive to accept investment
  2) Discount rate - used to find value of future number of money today
  3) Opportunity cost - a value forgone when choosing particular course of action (e.g.: n dollars spent today is at an opportunity cost of earning r% of it in a year)

Interest rate [r] = Real risk-free interest rate + Inflation premium + Default risk premium + Liquidity premium + Maturity premium

  1) Real risk-free interest rate - single-perio interest rate for a completely risk-free security if no inflation is expected (reflects time preferences of current vs future real consumption)
  2) Inflation premium - compensated for expected inflation (reflects expected average inflation rate over maturity of the debt, RRF Interest rate + Inflation premium = Nominal risk-free interest rate)
  3) Default risk premium - compensated for the possibility of borrower failing to pay at the contracted time and in the contracted amount
  4) Liquidity risk premium - compensated for the risk of loss of value due to investment being required to be converted to cash quickly (T-Bills can be bought/sold with no effect on market price so it doesnt have it)
  5) Maturity premium - compensated for the sensitivity of investment value due to changes in market interest rates throughout the maturity period

Present and Future Values:
  FV_N = PV(1+r)^N 

    FV_N - Future Value of the Investment after N periods of time passed
    PV - Present Value of the Investment
    r - interest rate compounded over the unit time (must be consistent with N)
    N - period of time passed

A timeline can be used to illustrate relationship between value of the money and time:

t: 0--------------------------------------------------------------------------------N-->
Value:  PV                                                                 FV_N = PV(1+r)^N

Non-Annual Compounding Interest Rate:
  FV_N = PV(1+r_s/m)^mN

    FV_N - Future Value of the Investment after N years passed
    PV - Present Value of the Investment
    r_s - stated annual interest rate
    N - number of years
    m - number of compounding periods per year

  Stated interest rate is stated by bank, if stated monthly interest rate is 8%, then stated interest rate per annum is 0.08*12 = 0.67%, however (1+0.0067)^12 = 1.083 != 1.08

Continuous Compounding:
  FV_N = PV*e^(r_sN)

    FV_N - Future Value of the Investment after N periods of time passed
    PV - Present Value of the Investment
    r_s - stated annual interest rate
    N - number of years

  When interest is compounded infinitely, it is said to be compounded continuously, the value of m becomes infinite which approximates lim m->inf (1+const./m)^m = e

Stated vs Effective rates:

  Effective Annual Rate = (1 + Periodic Interest Rate)^m - 1 = e^r_s - 1

Series of Cash Flows:
  Annuity - finite set of level sequential cash flows
  Ordinary annuity - has a first cash flow occuring one period from now (at t = 1)
  Annuity due - has a first cash flow occuring immediately (at t = 1)
  Perpetuity - perpetual annuity, a set of never-ending sequential cash flows, with first cash flow occuring one period from now

  FV_N = A[((1+r)^N)-1]/r

  [((1+r)^N)-1]/r -> Annuity Factor
      
    FV_N - Future Value of the Investment after N periods of time passed
    A - annuity amount
    r - interest rate per period
    
With unequal cash flows, calculate future value of each cash flow and find the sum

Present value:

  PV = FV_N(1+r)^-N
  If total number of periods = 10, then N = 10 for present value, N = 6 for value in 4 years from now

Non-Annual Compounding Present value:

  PV = FV_N(1+r_S/m)^-mN

    N - Number of years
    m - number of compounding periods per year
    r_s - quoted annual interest rate

Present Value of Series of Equal Cash Flows:

  PV = A [(1-(1+r)^-N)/r]

  A - constant annuity amount
  r - interest rate per period corresponding to the frequency of annuity payments
  N - number of annuity payments

Present Value of Series of Unequal Cash Flows:

  Find present value of each individual cash flow, then sum up

Present Value of a Pepetuity:

  PV = A * sum t=1 -> inf [1/(1+r)^t]
  When r is positive -> the series converge to PV = A/r
